title: Week One Roundup
---

The first week of Metis Cohort 6 has come to a close! We've done so much in so little time, mainly starting (and finishing) Project Benson. The task was to use MTA turnstile data, along with other data sources, to make recommendations to a fictional nonprofit supporting women in technology on where to place its street teams. The purpose of the outreach was both financial and awareness-raising, so we had to think creatively about what to emphasize and the approach to take.<br><br>

My team started by narrowing down the potential locations. We identified two key factors: income level, which would demonstrate ability to donate, and proximity to selected 'tech hubs', which would attract the attention of those in technology. We used these parameters to create a simple weighting algorithm to score each zip code:<br><br>

Alpha in the above equation represents how much to emphasize proximity to tech vs how much to emphasize income in ranking the zip codes. For instance, with an alpha equal to zero, the ranking would be entirely based on income. Alternatively, an alpha of 1 ranks the zip codes by number of tech startups.
