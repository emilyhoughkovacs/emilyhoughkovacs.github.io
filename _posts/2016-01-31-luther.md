title: Project Luther: Film Sales in International Markets
---

The past two weeks have flown by. This Friday I finished a project regarding the percentage of the foreign gross total of a film that comes from Hungary. Although Hungary is a small country, I made the assumption that the foreign distribution of films has a long tail. The motivation of this project was to use machine learning to determine which countries would be the best smaller countries to distribute a film in to maximize foreign gross.<br>

The data I used was from the foreign tab for each film in the past six years on [BoxOfficeMojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/). I scraped the data using [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). Formulating a question and scraping the data took me the better part of a week. Then, on Tuesday of this week, a deadline for a [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) was sprung upon us. This means that we had to have something to show for our data, ideally a regression of some sort -- by the end of the day. Yikes!<br>

By the end of day Tuesday, I had scrapped together linear regression using only budget to predict Hungarian percentage.<br>

Although plotting the linear regression on top of the data points was giving me trouble, it was obvious that budget alone was not going to be a very strong predictor. I kept my hopes up, however.<br>

Towards the end of the week, I had prettied up my data and broken out some categorical variables. The features I had were runtime, budget (in millions), G/PG/PG-13/R rating (categorial), genre (categorical) and Hungarian distributor (categorical). I had also created three more features: a boolean value of whether the Hungarian and American distributors were the same, and two time-delta variables: the number of days after the foreign release that the Hungarian release occurred, and the number of days after the American release that the first foreign release occurred. I was ready to run my machine learning regression.<br>

The machine learning tool I chose was [ridge regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization). This method creates a linear regression model with an error term that corrects for the features chosen for the regression. The coefficient on the error term is the <i>lambda</i> value. A higher lambda indicates a worse linear regression and will predict a more generalized model. A lower lambda indicates a good linear regression that needs little correction.<br>

I had slightly more than 500 entries in my dataset, so I reserved about 100 for my test data set. With the 400 remaining, I used <i>k</i>-fold cross-validation with a k of 4. This means I tested my model on itself four times for each lamdba value I chose. I then calculated the [standard error of the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error#Standard_error_of_the_mean) for each cross-validation set and averaged it over the chosen lamdba. Comparing across lambdas, my standard error decreased each time I increased the lamdba. Unfortunately, this indicated that my chosen features were not good predictors for the Hungarian percentage of foreign gross total.<br>

Given further time to investigate this project, I would search the web for features that may be better predictors for performance of a film in a given country. When I began the project, I operated under the assumption that my model would be applicable for any given country, but I now believe that features more relevant to the given country would be more accurate predictors. Until next time!<br>
