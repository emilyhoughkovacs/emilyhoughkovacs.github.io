title: Project Luther: Foreign Infiltration
---

The past two weeks have flown by. This Friday I finished a project regarding the percentage of the foreign gross total of a film that comes from Hungary. Although Hungary is a small country, I made the assumption that the foreign distribution of films has a long tail. The motivation of this project was to use machine learning to determine which countries would be the best smaller countries to distribute a film in to maximize foreign gross.<br>

The data I used was from the foreign tab for each film in the past six years on [BoxOfficeMojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/). I scraped the data using [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). Formulating a question and scraping the data took me the better part of a week. Then, on Tuesday of this week, a deadline for a [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) was sprung upon us. This means that we had to have something to show for our data, ideally a regression of some sort -- by the end of the day. Yikes!<br>

By the end of day Tuesday, I had scrapped together linear regression using only budget to predict Hungarian percentage.<br>

Although plotting the linear regression on top of the data points was giving me trouble, it was obvious that budget alone was not going to be a very strong predictor. I kept my hopes up, however.<br>

Towards the end of the week, I had prettied up my data and broken out some categorical variables. The features I had were runtime, budget (in millions), G/PG/PG-13/R rating (categorial), genre (categorical) and Hungarian distributor (categorical). I had also created three more features: a boolean value of whether the Hungarian and American distributors were the same, and two time-delta variables: the number of days after the foreign release that the Hungarian release occurred, and the number of days after the American release that the first foreign release occurred. I was ready to run my machine learning regression.<br>

The machine learning tool I chose was [ridge regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization).
