Over the past three weeks here at Metis, we've completed another machine learning project. The structure of this project was intended to expose us to classification algorithms, MySQL, and Amazon AWS. Although the project was first presented as a group project, we had the option to diverge into individual projects using the same dataset.<br>

My team worked extremely efficiently together, and our project was stronger as a whole because we worked closely. My team was self-selected by a mutual interest in <i>identifying refugee crises</i>. The question we wanted to answer was whether we could predict countries or zones that were at risk for refugee crises. Since everyone needed to implement their own classification algorithm, we designed our question as a meta-learning model, where the inputs to our final model would be outputs from each of our five individual models. Each of us predicted 'at risk' or 'not at risk', for every country in our dataset for 2013 (the most recent year of data that was available).
