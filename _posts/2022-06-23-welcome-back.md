title: Prepping for the Google Product Analyst Interview
---

Well, it's certainly been awhile (six years?!) since I've written in this blog. The last time I wrote, I was wrapping up my time at the <a href="https://www.thisismetis.com/bootcamps/online-data-science-bootcamp">data science bootcamp, Metis</a>. Since then, I've worked at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/emilyhoughkovacs">Spotify</a> for five years with a short stint at Universal Music Group after that. Now I'm interviewing for the <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/117194879722758854-product-analyst-data-science/">Product Analyst: Data Science role at Google</a> and in preparation for the technical screen, I'd like to write down a little bit about the material I've been reviewing.

Right now I'm primarily using <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn">DataCamp</a> to hone my skills, but I plan to expand that to other resources if there's enough time, including the internal resources given by the recruiter and other websites like <a href="https://www.tryexponent.com/">Exponent</a>. I plan to keep notes of all my study sessions on this blog for you to follow along in the process, and hopefully guide anyone else who may be interviewing for the same or similar roles. Wish me luck!
